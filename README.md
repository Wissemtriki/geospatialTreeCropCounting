# Geospatial Tree and Crop Counting with Drone Streams

This project was developed during my summer internship at AVIONAV Tunisia, a company specialized in building touristic planes and drones. The system uses geospatial analysis to count and locate trees and crops by processing real-time streams captured by drones. The model is built using Python and Scikit-Learn for analyzing vegetation areas and generating accurate spatial insights.
